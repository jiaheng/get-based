Closes 31+ attribute-breakout sites across supplements, context cards, client list, chat, views, cycle, EMF, PDF import, and provider panels that were previously vulnerable to self-XSS via user-authored strings containing a bare double quote.',
      'Tightened Vercel API proxy allowlist — blocks SSRF into private (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), loopback, link-local, and cloud-metadata IP ranges. Public HTTPS endpoints still pass so Custom API and decentralized Routstr nodes keep working.',
