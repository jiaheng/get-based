    items: [
      '<b>RHR now matches what your Oura app shows.</b> Resting Heart Rate on the dashboard used the night-long average from Oura\'s sleep payload, which runs 5–10 bpm higher than the true RHR. The Oura app\'s "Resting Heart Rate" card and trend graph use the lowest 5-min average during sleep (typically hit in deep sleep) — we now source from the same field. Existing rows refresh on the next sync.',
      '<b>Bad-night zeros render as gaps instead of floor dots.</b> Oura emits a literal <code>0</code> for HRV/HR scalars when a sleep session has no usable data (ring not worn, signal lost, sub-threshold session). Those zeros used to flow through to the history chart as a dot at the floor and drag the weekly mean down. Now treated as missing across HR, HRV, weight, body composition, and sleep durations — legitimate zeros (rest-day steps, no high-stress minutes, perfect-sleep awake time, body-temp deviation centered at 0) still display normally.',
      '<b>Oura Rest Mode still gets its dedicated hint.</b> When Rest Mode is on, activity_score is 0 every day by design — the card stays visible and the detail modal shows a short explanation pointing you to the Steps card for raw movement data.',

    version: '1.7.6', date: '2026-05-13', title: 'MyHeritage Low-pass WGS: strand-aware SNP matching',
    items: [
      '<b>The "Genotype not in lookup" group is gone.</b> MyHeritage\'s 2025 Low-pass WGS export reports every SNP on the build37 forward strand, but our catalog stored a handful of variants keyed on the opposite strand — so calls like <code>AC</code> for <b>PCSK9 R46L</b> or <code>TT</code> for <b>UGT1A1 G71R</b> silently missed the table and ended up labeled "not in lookup" even though they\'re standard, well-characterized genotypes. SNP lookups now try the reverse-complement as a fallback when the direct read misses, so MyHeritage forward-strand calls resolve to the right catalog entry across all eight affected loci (PCSK9, MTR, UGT1A1, MTRR, BHMT, FADS1 coding, LIPC -514, MC1R). Palindromic A/T and C/G SNPs (where strand flipping is ambiguous) keep the strict lookup to avoid false positives.',
      '<b>Mild-effect SNPs now appear in their own group.</b> Two protective heterozygotes — <b>CETP I405V (AG)</b> and <b>CYP1A2 *1F (AC)</b> — were correctly matched against the catalog but bucketed into "not in lookup" because the import preview only recognized three impact tiers. They\'re now rendered as <b>🟠 Mild findings</b>, between Moderate and Normal.',
      '<b>Honest coverage count.</b> Imputation-noise calls (alleles that aren\'t valid for the variant under either strand — e.g. a <code>CG</code> read at a C/T SNP) are now dropped at parse time instead of inflating the "not in lookup" group. The "X of Y health-relevant SNPs found" line reflects actually-curated matches.',

    items: [
      '<b>Better readability in dark mode.</b> The muted grays used for footers, hints, and reference text were brightened to clear WCAG AA contrast on every background. A handful of small-text labels (footer trademarks, recommendation disclaimers) had a faint extra opacity layer that dragged them below threshold — that\'s gone now.',
      '<b>Form labels and screen reader names.</b> The chat onboarding fields, the Compare Dates picker, and several form selects now properly announce their purpose to screen readers. Marker-group expand/collapse buttons in the sidebar announce their open/closed state correctly as you toggle them.',
      '<b>Visible link cues.</b> The "primary study" / "more studies" links in the supplements card now carry a persistent underline so they\'re distinguishable without color alone.',
      '<b>Sidebar marker-group rows.</b> Mouse click-anywhere-on-row to toggle still works; keyboard navigation now lands on a real button rather than a div pretending to be one. The AI-context toggle stayed where it was, next to the flag count.',

    version: '1.7.4', date: '2026-05-12', title: 'See your values in both unit systems',
    items: [
      '<b>Alternate Units toggle (Settings → Display).</b> When on, the marker detail modal shows each value in both the active system AND the other one — <i>5.20 mmol/L · ≈ 93.7 mg/dL</i> for glucose, <i>140 mmol/L · ≈ 140 mEq/L</i> for sodium, <i>8.5 mU/L · ≈ 8.5 µIU/mL</i> for insulin. Off by default to keep the modal uncluttered for single-locale users. Reference + optimal ranges also render in both systems so a US user reading a Quest report (in <code>µIU/mL</code>) can match it against the app\'s EU SI numbers (in <code>mU/L</code>) without flipping the global toggle. Per-profile preference, persists across sessions.',
      '<b>Type values in either unit on manual entry.</b> The "+ Add Value Manually" form now offers a small unit picker next to the value field for markers with a known conversion. Default is the current display unit; flip it to type a value straight from a lab report printed in the other system, and the app converts to canonical SI before storage. Round-trip stays exact (5 mmol/L in, 5 mmol/L back out via the alt unit and home). The range sanity-check now uses alt-unit ranges so typing <i>90 mg/dL</i> in EU mode doesn\'t spuriously flag against the SI ref range.',
      '<b>Expanded unit coverage.</b> Added real conversions for <b>eGFR</b> (mL/s → mL/min), <b>GFR Cystatin</b>, <b>Cystatin C</b>, <b>hs-CRP</b>, and <b>CRP</b> (all now gain mg/dL displays alongside SI). Added label-only entries for markers where the number is the same but the printed label differs on US reports: <b>insulin</b> (mU/L = µIU/mL), <b>TSH</b>, <b>LH</b>, <b>FSH</b>, <b>sodium / potassium / chloride</b> (mmol/L = mEq/L), <b>WBC / RBC / platelets / differential absolute counts</b> (×10⁹/L = K/µL, ×10¹²/L = M/µL). Total coverage: 81 of 124 markers (was 66). Truly universal markers like homocysteine and percentages stay no-toggle since the label is the same in both systems.',
      '<b>MyHeritage Low-pass WGS imports work again.</b> MyHeritage\'s 2025 raw-data export prepends a <code>##fileformat=MyHeritage</code> comment block before the column header, which the detector was reading as the first line and failing on. The CSV now imports normally.',
      '<b>Bugfix: stale marker after switching unit systems.</b> If you flipped EU↔US while the manual-entry form was prepared, the form could carry the old display unit forward and convert your input through the wrong factor on save. The form now re-resolves every marker on open and on save, picking up the current display unit each time.',

    // override the patch-skip in maybeShowChangelog and force the modal
    // even for users on the same major.minor (1.7.0 → 1.7.1).
    forceShow: true,
    items: [
      '<b>Apple Health ZIP imports work again.</b> Dropping an <code>export.zip</code> on Settings → Wearables → Apple Health was throwing "JSZip not loaded" — direct <code>.xml</code> drops were unaffected, but the ZIP path is the one most people use. The vendor unzip bundle now lazy-loads on first use. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Savi-1">@Savi-1</a> for the patch.',
      '<b>Encrypted backups, fixed — please re-export.</b> If you had encryption-at-rest turned on, every backup since v1.6.x silently exported <code>profiles: []</code> — a ~1 KB file with only your global settings, no profile data. Manual export, auto-backup, and folder-backup were all affected. Backups taken before today on encrypted installs are not recoverable; <b>strongly recommend re-exporting a fresh backup after updating.</b> Going forward, backups round-trip your profile data correctly. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Savi-1">@Savi-1</a> for the patch.',
      '<b>Security hardening.</b> Tightened the allowlist for marker keys interpolated into inline click handlers — defense-in-depth against a theoretical XSS via a maliciously-crafted lab PDF. PDF AI extraction was already sanitized at the parse boundary; this adds the same guard at the render boundary so legacy data and sync pulls can\'t slip through either.',

    items: [
      '<b>The Medical Conditions card is now Medical History</b> — same place, broader scope. Beneath your own diagnoses, a new <b>Family history</b> subsection captures first-degree relatives plus grandparents (mother, father, sibling, child, maternal/paternal grandmothers and grandfathers). Each entry takes a condition, optional age of onset, and an optional note. Family history reframes risk interpretation — a father\'s heart attack at 52 makes a borderline LDL more actionable, and the AI sees both your own diagnoses and what runs in the family.',
      '<b>The conditions list nearly tripled.</b> Was 27 entries (mostly metabolic / endocrine / GI). Now ~117, covering neuro (Alzheimer\'s, Parkinson\'s, Epilepsy, MS, migraine), 19 cancer categories (breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, melanoma, pancreatic, ovarian, lymphoma, leukemia, …), skin (Psoriasis, eczema, rosacea), mental health (bipolar, ADHD, autism, PTSD, OCD), additional autoimmune, musculoskeletal, eye, hearing, infectious / chronic, and several genetic / congenital conditions worth surfacing in family history. Autocomplete-clickable conditions with apostrophes (Alzheimer\'s, Hashimoto\'s, Crohn\'s, Graves\', Sjögren\'s, Cushing\'s, Parkinson\'s, Huntington\'s) — previously broken from the dropdown — are clickable again.',
      '<b>Notes on individual lab values.</b> Every reading in the marker detail modal now has a small <b>+ note</b> on hover. Attach context tied to a single date/marker: <i>"fasted 14h"</i>, <i>"retook because cuff felt loose"</i>, <i>"different lab"</i>, <i>"post-workout"</i>. Notes show as an italic line beneath the value; click to edit, × to remove. The AI sees these notes grouped by marker so a single reading\'s context can change how it\'s interpreted.',
      '<b>Manual entry is much faster for paper lab reports.</b> The marker modal\'s "+ Add Value" button moved above the Note section and is renamed <b>+ Add Value Manually</b> for clarity. The form gained: a <b>Save & Add Another</b> button that keeps the date and clears the value (enter a whole report top-to-bottom without re-picking dates), an optional <b>Note</b> field that saves to the per-value notes above, a <b>range sanity check</b> that flags values >10× the upper bound or <1/10 the lower bound (catches decimal/unit slips), a <b>duplicate-date confirm</b> that shows the existing value before overwriting, and a <b>session-remembered last date</b> so the next entry defaults to whatever date you just used. Plus: Enter to save, Esc to cancel, no future dates allowed.',
      '<b>Click any empty cell in Table view to add a value</b> with that column\'s date pre-filled. The view mode (Charts / Table / Heatmap) now sticks across navigation and survives saves.',
      '<b>Blood pressure renders as one card</b> ("120/80 mmHg") instead of two. Storage stays unchanged — sys and dia are still tracked separately under the hood — but the card face and detail view present them paired like every other BP app.',
      '<b>Manual BP entry, fixed.</b> Tapping the diastolic field no longer kicks the cursor back to systolic. The same idempotency fix also stops the form from rebuilding on every click inside it.',
      '<b>Table and Heatmap views hide markers you have no data for.</b> A 50-row category with values in 8 markers no longer scrolls past 42 rows of dashes — only markers with at least one reading render. Categories with no data at all show a one-line "import a PDF or use the sidebar" hint instead of an empty table.',
      '<b>Sticky header in Compare Dates.</b> Scroll long tables and the dates header stays on screen. Single page scrollbar (the old approach gave you two).',
      '<b>Inline value editing</b> now uses a full-width input instead of an 80px cell that clipped multi-digit values, refreshes the underlying table/heatmap on save (was showing stale values), and treats Escape as a real cancel (no longer flips your imported value to "manual" if you press Esc without changing anything).',
      '<b>PDF import accepts extensionless files</b> — magic-byte sniff catches files exported with no extension (common with OCRFeeder on Linux).',
      '<b>Wearable manual entry got chip + note parity.</b> The "+ Add reading" form in the detail modal now offers the same context chips (resting / morning-fasted / post-workout / stress for BP and RHR) and a freeform note field that the dashboard empty-card form has had. Notes show up under the reading in the entries list, and feed the AI alongside the numbers.',
      '<b>Category navigation no longer bounces to Dashboard.</b> Clicking 3M / 6M / 1Y range buttons, deleting a value, or saving a PDF import — anywhere the sidebar rebuilds in response — used to read a stale "active" state and redirect you to Dashboard. Fixed across all 10 places that had the pattern.',
      '<b>Bugfixes & improvements.</b> Family-history relative picker is grouped into Parents / Siblings & Children / Maternal grandparents / Paternal grandparents. Each family-history entry shows a small relative chip with emoji so a long list reads scannably by "who" before "what". The add-entry form stacks cleanly into two rows on mobile. Manual-entry value input width is now responsive (was clipping 6+ digit values like cholesterol or testosterone). Friendlier empty-state hints throughout Table / Heatmap / Family-history sections. Cross-device sync covers the new per-value notes and family history under the same per-row CRDT path everything else uses — no migration needed.',

      '<b>"Push committed but never arrived"</b> — a small fraction of Evolu sync owners hit a state where the relay acked every push but never persisted anything, so a freshly-imported PDF would simply never show up on another device. Diagnose modal now flags this case explicitly (red dot, "your relay storage is empty despite recent pushes") and offers a one-click <b>Rotate identity</b> to recover. Server-side detection landed in the relay too.',
      '<b>Sun & weather data on airplane.</b> CAMS / Open-Meteo fetches now time out cleanly, fall back gracefully, and don\'t freeze the UV strip when you\'re offline. AI streams + requests gained timeouts so a wedged provider can\'t hang the chat panel.',
      '<b>Scroll-anchor stability.</b> Rapid navigation through AI-verdict cards no longer jumps around — the page restores to the element you focused, not a guessed pixel offset.',
      '<b>Measurement retention redesign.</b> Light & Sun room measurements now keep only the latest reading per (room, tool) instead of every historical sample. Walkthrough audits stay full-history.',
