# getbased — Health intelligence that's actually yours

**getbased** is a personal health intelligence platform organized around five lenses on your biology — Labs, Genome, Body, Light, Insight. Every lens informs every other: your DNA shapes how labs are interpreted, your wearable physiology shapes which biomarkers matter most, your light environment shapes your sleep and your hormones, and the AI synthesizes across all of them with full context. Free, open-source, private by default — all data stored locally in your browser with no account required.

## Five lenses

- **🩸 Labs** — biomarkers, ranges, trends, biological age across 287+ markers
- **🧬 Genome** — 47 curated SNPs, APOE haplotype, 39 mtDNA haplogroups, DNA-aware insights
- **⌚ Body** — wearables (Oura, Fitbit, Withings, Polar, Apple Health, plus WHOOP + Ultrahuman gated on partner credentials), biometrics, recovery, cycle
- **☀ Light** — sun exposure with CAMS-fed atmospheric data, photobiology devices, indoor light environment, 8 measurement tools
- **🧠 Insight** — AI chat, custom knowledge base, correlations, recommendations

## What it does

- **AI-powered PDF import** — drop any lab report (any format, language, or country) and AI extracts and maps results to 287+ known biomarkers automatically. Batch import, direct image import (JPG/PNG/WebP), auto image mode for scanned PDFs
- **Biomarker trend charts** — interactive line charts with proportional time scale, reference bands, optimal ranges, and trend detection across 17 standard categories
- **AI chat** — ask questions about your results with full health context, image attachments, multiple personalities, conversation threads
- **DNA import** — upload raw data from AncestryDNA, 23andMe, MyHeritage, FTDNA, Living DNA, or Illumina GenomeStudio (DNAEra and other clinical labs). 47 curated SNPs across 13 categories (methylation, iron, lipids, vitamin D, alcohol, caffeine, body composition, etc.) with APOE haplotype resolution and 39 mtDNA haplogroups including 11 sub-clades. Genetic factors shown on dashboard, detail modals, and in AI context
- **Wearable integrations** — connect Oura, Fitbit, Withings, Polar, or Apple Health (file import). HRV, resting heart rate, sleep score, readiness, activity, steps, weight, BP, body composition (Withings Body Scan: body fat %, muscle mass, vascular age, PWV, nerve health), SpO₂, body temperature, sleep architecture, and more — surfaced on the dashboard alongside your lab results. Multi-vendor source picker per metric. Manual entry first-class for weight / BP / RHR (no wearable required). Raw daily samples stay on-device; OAuth tokens never sync; only a compact ~200-token L2 summary propagates via Evolu CRDT. WHOOP and Ultrahuman gated to "waiting on partner credentials" until vendor approval lands. See [docs.getbased.health/guides/wearables](https://docs.getbased.health/guides/wearables)
- **Specialty lab adapters** — OAT (165 markers), fatty acids (Spadia, ZinZino, OmegaQuant), Metabolomix+. Any other specialty test imports through the custom marker pipeline
- **Biological age** — PhenoAge (Levine 2018) + Bortz Age (Bortz 2023) combined into a unified Biological Age marker with component breakdown
- **Calculated markers** — HOMA-IR, BUN/Creatinine ratio, free water deficit, lipid ratios (TG/HDL, LDL/HDL, ApoB/ApoA-I), NLR, PLR, De Ritis ratio, hs-CRP/HDL cardiovascular risk ratio
- **Trend alerts** — sudden changes and linear regression flagged on the dashboard
- **Correlation viewer** — compare any two markers, heatmap view
- **Compare dates** — side-by-side comparison of any two lab dates
- **Manual entry** — add results without a PDF, create custom biomarkers
- **Interpretive lens** — frame AI analysis through specific scientific paradigms or experts
- **Custom Knowledge Source** — connect your own document collection (research papers, clinical guides, any texts) to ground AI analysis in real sources. The AI searches your knowledge base for relevant passages before interpreting your labs, and cites them back to you
- **9 lifestyle context cards** — diet & digestion, sleep, exercise, stress, light & circadian, environment, EMF assessment (Baubiologie SBM-2015), and more — each gets an AI health rating and enriches all interpretations
- **Menstrual cycle tracking** — phase-aware reference ranges, cycle phase bands on charts, perimenopause detection, symptom tracking
- **Supplement & medication timeline** — overlaid on charts to correlate with biomarker changes
- **PDF reports** — export a full health report as PDF
- **Multi-profile** — track multiple people, client list with search/sort/filter

## Privacy and data ownership

- All data stored locally in your browser (localStorage + IndexedDB) — nothing on a server
- Personal info stripped from PDFs before AI processing (regex + streaming local AI obfuscation)
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest
- Automatic backups (IndexedDB snapshots + daily folder backup via File System Access API)
- Venice AI end-to-end encryption option — prompts encrypted client-side (ECDH secp256k1 + AES-256-GCM), decrypted only inside a TEE. Nothing readable in transit or at rest on their servers
- Run a local AI server and nothing leaves your machine at all
- No account, no sign-up, no tracking

## Agent Access

Opt-in feature that lets AI agents query your lab context — coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor), messenger bots (Hermes Agent, OpenClaw), or any MCP-compatible tool.

- Enable in **Settings → Data → Agent Access** to generate a read-only token
- Context is pushed to a lightweight gateway on every save and profile switch
- Per-profile: each profile's context is stored separately; agents can query any profile by ID
- Install on Linux with one command: `curl -sSL https://getbased.health/install.sh | bash` (`pipx install --include-deps "getbased-agent-stack[full]"` for manual / cross-platform installs). [getbased-agents](https://github.com/elkimek/getbased-agents) bundles the MCP adapter, local RAG knowledge server, and browser setup dashboard. Works with [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/hermes-agent/hermes-agent), [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, or any MCP-compatible agent
- Only the AI-readable context text is shared — never your mnemonic or raw lab data
- Token is revocable at any time from the same settings panel

## AI providers

| Provider | Description |
|---|---|
| **PPQ** | 300+ models, no KYC. Bitcoin, Lightning, Monero, Litecoin. Top up directly in the app. |
| **Routstr** | Decentralized Bitcoin AI. Built-in Cashu wallet, Nostr node discovery. Fund with Lightning, pick any node. |
| **OpenRouter** | 200+ models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok). Pay with card or USDC. One-click OAuth. |
| **Venice AI** | Uncensored models with optional E2EE. No-log policy. |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elkimek/get-based
cd get-based
node dev-server.js
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. You need an AI provider API key or local AI server for PDF import and chat. All other features work without one.

## Docker

Build and run the Node-based server image:

```bash
docker build -t getbased .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e HOST=0.0.0.0 -e PORT=8000 getbased
```

The container uses `npm start`, which runs `dev-server.js` so local API and proxy routes remain available.

## Tech stack

Web app only — no build tools, no bundler, no package manager. Pure ES modules under `js/`.

- Chart.js for interactive charts
- pdf.js for PDF text extraction
- transformers.js + OPFS for the browser-local Lens (Custom Knowledge Source)
- Evolu for optional CRDT sync (E2E encrypted)
- Most runtime dependencies vendored in `vendor/`
- Installable as a PWA (works offline for non-AI features)

```

Open `index.html` (or start `node dev-server.js` for development) and the dashboard runs.

## Testing

Node-side helpers plus Puppeteer-driven browser assertions, all run headlessly (`ls tests/test-*.js | wc -l` for the current count):

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

Starts a local server, runs all tests via Puppeteer, exits 0/1.
